Features:
	optimization - aside from Google Analytics and New Relic, everything is AOK according to Google Page speed. 
		Brainstorm other ways to make the site load more quickly (aside from buying dynos) 

	Sent post to twitter (without adding twitter authorization)
	analytics - AARRR steps

	Show off find/replace magic on the site, not just chrome extension
		Perhaps open the offending page in a new tab with an iframe/wrapper and the find/replace diff highlighted.
	websnapr jquery qtip for url - shows a free preview screenshot of the url as a tooltip (I like the above idea better)
	mozilla persona for alternate login - it's clean and simple and doesn't require connecting other personal accounts (FB/Twitter).
	 
	site-wide keyword searches (while keeping the extra keys in redis to a minimum)
		take difference in two phrases, add those words as "keywords" for searching
	spell check (or are grammar police better than that?)
		free tools for spell check: bjspell, afterthedeadline


Refactoring:
	break up logic in the login.rb and main.rb files. It's not terrible but if I could make it more readable by moving things to helper functions, then great.
	don't add more layers of abstraction, you get to do that at work and it's harder to follow without breaking the no-documentation rule.

Welsh corgis:
	Do you think if you made little shoes like Vibram five-fingers for their tiny paws, that might help them?
	They were clearly thrown down Darwin's crap chute by dog breeders, so we owe them something, right?
